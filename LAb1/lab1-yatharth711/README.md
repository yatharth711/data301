## Submission Instructions

Once you are done with both Lab1A and Lab1B, **you will need to submit a snapshot of your repository for grading on Gradescope**.

I have recorded a video with some instructions on how to submit your lab on Gradescope:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/570761775?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Submitting your GitHub Classroom assignment via Gradescope"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

[Click here to view the video in a new browser window](https://vimeo.com/570761775).

The same instructions are summarized here in text:

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment (You would have already done this in lab1A Task 1)

1. Commit and push your change to GitHub.

1. Log in to your Canvas course, and click Gradescope in the left sidebar.

1. You will be enrolled in the course and receive a confirmation email. Gradescope will also open in a new window/tab with your course dashboard and all active assignments.

1. If this is your first time using Gradescope, you will need to set a password:

In the confirmation email you received from Gradescope, click the set your password link.
Enter the same password in the password and password confirmation fields, and click Set Password.

1. You can now access Gradescope through your Canvas course.

1. When in Gradescope, click the course and you will see a list of assignments. Select the assignment you want to submit.

1. Before you can start submitting work, you may see a dialog box telling you that your assignment will be timed. Read the information carefully, and click Start Assignment only when youâ€™re ready for the countdown to begin.

1. The first time you do this, you will need to sync your GitHub account with Gradescope, and GRANT permission to our GitHub organization.

1. Once you log in and link your GitHub account, you should find the repository and submit it to Gradescope.

1. Gradescope will email you a confirmation of your submitted work, with a link to the submission.

Note: If you make any future commits to this repository, you will need to re-submit on Gradescope.
You may resubmit as many times as you like before the deadline + grace period, but you will not be able to commit after this time!

You are all done with Lab 1!

Congratulations!

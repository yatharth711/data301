# Lab 1B - BashCrawl

This activity is a really fun way to learn how to use some of the Terminal commands you will need to know.

**This lab must be completed individually.**

## Objectives

- Practice with Terminal interfaces
- Create and navigate directories
- Create, modify, rename and delete files
- Understand Git and Git fundamentals

## Task 1: BashCrawl

Here is a [video guide](https://youtu.be/QtxwgG2u6Uc) to the first few steps of this lab.

### Setting up for the game

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Change the directory to where this file is: `cd /path/to/this/folder`.
3. Type `ls` into the Terminal; you will see two things: `README.md` and the `entrance` directory.
4. Once you go into the `entrance` directory (`cd entrance`), the Terminal-based game will begin!

**Tip: When I say "go into the <BLANK>" room, I mean change directories using `cd <BLANK>`. In this game, a "room" is a "directory".**

### Starting the game

5. Now that you have entered the dungeon `entrance`, you should type `ls` in the terminal to look around and see what's there.

6. You will see there are two "things" in this room,  there is a `scroll`, and another room called `cellar`.

7. Let's read the scroll using `cat scroll`.

**Tip: When I say "read the scroll", I mean output the contents of the scroll file into the Terminal using `cat scroll`.**

8. Great! The scroll told us that we can look and see what's in the room using `ls` and move in and out of rooms using `cd <directory>`. Let's go into the cellar: `cd cellar`.

9. Once we're in the `cellar`, let's have a look around: `ls`. You should see an `armoury`, a `scroll`, and some `treasure`.

10. Let's read the scroll: `cat scroll`. It should tell you about `ls -F`. Here is some more information about `ls -F`:

> Display a slash (`/`) immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk ('*') after each that is executable, an AT sign ('@') after each symbolic link. 

11. That sounds useful, let's do an `ls -F` in the cellar to see what each of the things are. You'll notice that the armoury is another room, the scroll is just a file, and the treasure has a "*" at the end, so it's an executable. Cool! We don't know what to do with the executable yet, but let's try `cat treasure` to see what happens.

12. Mm. Didn't work - okay let's move on and come back to this room later. Let's go into the `armoury` now: `cd armoury` and then `ls -F`.

13. We see another scroll (and a potion, a treasure, and another room)! Let's read the scroll: `cat scroll`.

14. Oooh, we have now learned how to collect `treasure`! Let's do that in the armoury and follow the instructions to keep our treasure (using environment variables).

**Tip: When I say "pick up the `<BLANK>`", I mean run the executable file using `./ <BLANK>`.**

15. It tells us to go back and get the treasure from the cellar! Let's go and do that now with `cd ..`, pick up the treasure from the cellar, and then come back to the armoury.

16. The potion is also something we can "pick up", so let's go ahead and do that. It asks us if you want to drink it: type 'Y' for yes, and anything else for no (like 'n'). Choose an option and see what happens (follow on-screen instructions!)

17. Alright check if there's anything else to do this in room, if not, head to the `chamber` next. Start with `ls -F` and hopefully by now, you know the drill!

18. Have fun! More dungeon rooms will open up as you complete certain tasks, kill certain monsters, and read specific scrolls and tomes. Have fun with it, this is your opportunity to practice your Terminal skills - it sure beats the way I learned Terminal commands (blindly typing in commands in a black box until I got it to do what I wanted!). There is no need to hit **every** room in the dungeon, but do make a concerted effort and you'll likely get most of the marks for this lab.

**Tip: You can ignore a few of the more "advanced" entries of the Tome, including anything related to `tmux` or `gzip`. I say "pick up the <BLANK>", I mean run the executable file using `./ <BLANK>`.**

### What you need to submit for Bashcrawl.

When you're done exploring the dungeon there are several things I want you to do:

#### 1. Commit everything to your repository and push to the cloud:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Finished playing with the dungeon"
git push
```

#### 2. Run `tree`, and save the output to a file :

On Windows, if you cannot find the tree command, please follow the instructions in the [setup guide](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/2021_ST2/data301/notes/setup/install_ds_stack_windows.html#tree).

On Linux or macOS, you may need to install tree (if you didn't already do it in the dungeon) with: `conda install -c conda-forge tree`

```
tree
tree > mydungeonmap.md
```

#### 3. Commit the dungeon map to your repository 

Run the following commands in your Terminal:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added my dungeon map"
git push
```

#### 4. Save the last 100 commands from your Terminal

We want to see some serious effort with the dungeon map, so we are asking for the last 100 commands you entered into the Terminal.
Please open this file and do a quick check to make sure there is no sensitive information in this file (like passwords or private messages).
If there is, you can simply edit file or remove that command.

**Note: Just because we're asking for the last 100 commands doesn't mean that we expect you to have 100 commands, you may have less and you may have more. That's fine.**

```
history 100 > dungeonHistory.md
```
#### 5. Commit the dungeon history to your repository 

Run the following commands in your Terminal:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added my dungeon map"
git push
```

#### 6. Submit the link to your GitHub.com repo to Canvas

You're done!

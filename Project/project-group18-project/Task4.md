# Task 4- Analysis

## Analysis

## Answering Research Question

**_(Chris Grace)Research Question 1 - What period sawthe most community spread during the
pandemic?_**

By looking at the graph above it can be said thatthe peak in India was in September, In the US and
Brazil, it was in July, France peaked in May and Russiapeaked in June. Among these nations
France, India had nationwide lockdowns and the resthad lockdowns determined by States and
Provinces around this same time. After these nationsand in turn provinces and states unlocked,
however, cases started to increase vastly. We cansay the periods where they peaked is when
community spread was at its peak.


**_(Chris Grace)Research Question 2 - Did the resultingcommunity spread contribute to herd
immunity and lead to a reduction of deaths?_**

In 4/5 countries the resulting community spread contributedto a reduction of deaths. In the US,
during the peak, we can see that the cases were atan all-time high however deaths were still quite
low, this is because the peak led to a large numberof people being infected and hence a lower
amount of deaths as re-infections were milder. InBrazil, France and Russia a similar trend emerges.
We can hence say that the community spread led toa reduction of cases, and herd immunity did
play a part in ending the first wave.

**_(Anikait Kapur)Research Question 3 - Did the lockdownin India have a positive effect on the
new cases?_**


From the first two graphs, it was pretty evident thenumber of cases was increasing during the
lockdown. Looking at the scatter graph of daily cases.a steady increase in cases, as well as a
positive correlation, can be seen. Both of these factorsare evidence that suggests that the lockdown
was not able to stop the spread of covid-19 however,it was able to limit it. This is seen from the bar
plot with %Active cases. While the %Active also increasedat a steady rate, during the lockdown, the
percentage maxed out at 0.007% which is very minuscule.



**_(Anikait Kapur)Research Question 4 - Was herd immunitya viable option for dealing with
Covid-19?_**


Herd Immunity, although, was not able to fully stopcovid-19, it was able to limit the spread. Looking
at the line graph, it can be seen that while the numberof daily deaths increases, the rate of increase
decreases slightly. This suggests that Herd Immunity increased people's immunity which in turn is
evidence that it is indeed a viable way of dealingwith covid-19. Further evidence of this is seen
through the pair plot. In the pair plot, all the linegraphs seen a decrease in their gradients which
suggests that the rate of spread was decreasing. Muchlike the line graph, this is further proof that
Herd Immunity did indeed decrease the spread of covid-19by increasing people's resistance to it.


**_(Yatharth Mathur)Research Question 5 - Which time period had a more significant rise in
total cases when compared to each other?_**


Ans: When compared the two timelines, ie. times of nationalized lockdown and non-nationalized
lockdown, we notice that the countries have had alesser population impacted in the months o April
to June. On the first bar graph, we notice only TheUnited States of America had a significant cases
surge and had a good amount of population gettingimpacted. Even if you look at the pair plot you
will observe that Total Cases had a significant rise too from the two time periods. But, few values
have remained somewhat constant. we notice that theTotal Recovered have been equally high, and
the number of deaths has also been showing similar outcomes. Thus we can conclude, Lockdowns
helped us keep the cases low, but as the countrieseased lockdown laws the cases surged in many
third-world countries specifically. Statistics suggestas per the above analysis, the months between
had a growth of 83080516 cases, but between July toSeptember, the increase in cases was
206915789.0 more. This difference in growth provedthat nationalized lockdowns in countries were
effective.



**_(Yatharth Mathur)Research Question 6 - Was the positivepatient percentage in these two time
frames different or did they still remain the same?_**
No, as we see the bar graphs, the Percentage value grew significantly after the lockdown laws were
eased out in many countries. The population rise alsodid not play that much of a significant role,
because the number of cases going up was way higher.This, just proves that the lockdown had a
significant impact on keeping cases low in the overallpercentage of the population.

---------------------

## Conclusion Drawn

Overall the conclusion is that during lockdown the number of cases rising were compartively lower, but there was 
a significant rise in deaths. We have also compared data speciically of a country to show how these patterns were observed
and at a global stance we can conlcude that the number of cases were the highest when overall nationalised lockdowns were 
removed.

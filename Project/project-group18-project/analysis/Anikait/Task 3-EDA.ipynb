Furthermore, I will also be breifly investigate whether or not a nationwide lockdown was a good way to fight covid-19. I will be focusing on India because it had one of the biggest nation wide lockdown during this pandemic. Furthermore, during its unlock phase, India implemented heard immunity alongside with minor measures such as masks and social distancing. "

While the %Active also increaed at a steady rate, during the lockdown, the percantage maxed out at 0.007% which is very miniscule."

Looking at the line graph, it can be seen that while the number of daily deaths increase, the rate of increase decreases slightly. This suggests that Herd Immunity increased people's immunity which in turn is evidence that it is indeed a viable way of dealing with covid-19. Further evidence of this is seen through the pairplot. In the pairplot, all the line graphs seen a decrease in their gradients which suggests that the rate of spread was decreasing.

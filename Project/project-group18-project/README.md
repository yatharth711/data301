## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We hope to analyze the data and find which approach better helped the country in question navigate the pandemic in terms of the economy, cases, deaths, and other factors affected as a result of the pandemic. We are interested in this topic because, coming from India, who chose a combination of lockdowns and unlocks(herd immunity) to tackle the pandemic, we want to know if, In reality, the lockdowns were more beneficial or detrimental to India. The effect it had on millions of Indians is still quite ambiguous as the lockdowns did negatively impact the lives of many Indians and sent many into poverty, whereas it did prevent deaths; however, the unlocks did quite the opposite and allowed Indians to live their lives while allowing covid to spread and take lives. This question is also quite politicized and, in our opinion, needs studying to debunk bogus claims about the pandemic. Hence we now raise a question on the efficiency and the results of lockdown. This analysis will help us answer whether the lockdown was an effective tool or whether the herd immunity situation after lockdowns were lifted in many countries was the way it should have been. We look forward to creating a dashboard to help users understand the importance and impact of lockdowns in general.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
Our data is chosen from WorldoMeter, a tool created by a data analytics company called Dadax. It is a tool used to calculate the total population and, in recent times, the amount of Covid-19 cases. With their data being openly available, we will be using the COVID-19 data set, which includes the number of cases, deaths etc., in each country. We shall be using the data collected from April to September 2020. The purpose of choosing this dataset is for accountability, interest. In a way, research as the general populous was told that lockdowns were impactful. The only way to contain covid, however, when looking at the world, after the first wave, many counties were better off after herd immunity before introducing variants(In terms of economy and other factors). On the other hand, lockdowns have been shown to work because countries that implemented such measures showed lower deaths and lower cases. The analysis shows which approach “worked” in terms of economics, cases, deaths. We plan on doing this by comparing countries that were hit hard by covid.

# DATA 301 Lab 2

In Lab 2 of this course, we will be diving straight into the thick of things and you'll be getting a taste of working with Git, and then Python.

The first part of this lab is about working through the learngitbranching tool.
In the second part, you will do some Python exercises with JupyterLab.

In the final part, you will record a 5-minute screencast of your lab.
This is what will be marked by the TAs and it is important that you be able to explain all of your solutions as a video.

## Instructions for Lab 2A

For this lab, you will need to open [`lab2B.md`](lab2B/README.md) and follow the instructions within.

## Instructions for Lab 2B

For this lab, you will need to open [`lab2B.ipynb`](lab2B/lab2B.ipynb) and follow the instructions within.

I have recorded a video to get you started with this lab: [Click here to view the video](https://vimeo.com/570824958).

- Some of these questions were inspired by Jerry's [Learn Python exercises](https://github.com/jerry-git/learn-python3/tree/master/notebooks/beginner/exercises)
- Thanks to Amir Zeinali and Dr. Ramon Lawrence for input on these exercises

## Lab 2 Explainer Video

Similar to last week, for each of the labs you submit, you will need to an "Explainer Video" showing highlights of your assignments.

Note that you only need to create ONE video per lab (so Lab 2A and 2B should be shown in ONE video).
For Lab2A, you should only explain *one* activity: "Main" --> "Merging in Git".
Here's an image of the git activity you should explain:

For Lab2B, you should explain all the questions.

### General suggestions for Explainer Videos:

**Important: If Vimeo and/or YouTube is blocked in your country and you are not able to upload your video to one of those two locations, please contact me on Ed Discussion ASAP and I will give you alternate instructions.**

- Your video should be a minimum of 5 minutes, and a maximum of 7 minutes.
- You do not need to explain every line of code! As a rough guideline, you should try to identify the **crucial or central component** of the question, and try to explain that.
- Thinking about the audience is important. Your explanation of your work would be different if you were explaining things to a peer, or someone who is not familiar with the content.
- For the Explainer videos You can assume that your audience is a relatively expert audience that is assessing your ability to explain your work.
- We will NOT be assessing "polish" so please do not waste your time doing multiple takes. I don't care if you say "umm" and "uhh" and "like" etc... just imagine you're having a conversation with me and speak however is natural to you.
- Your videos must be in English, and we will not be checking grammar, pronunciation, accents, speaking style, etc...
- Overall, do not be nervous and do not fear the Explainer videos. Only one TA and possibly the instructor will see your video and it will be private. 
- Use this opportunity to practice extremely important skill in Data Science! You will get better at it by the 5th video, I promise.
- If you really, really, really do not want to do Explainer Videos, you can instead choose to write an Explainer Essay instead. Please ask your instructor for permission before you choose this option, there are some guidelines I need to give you.

### Lab 2-specific suggestions for Explainer Video:

- You can choose to divide up the 5-7 mins as you like, but I prefer if you spend a little bit more time explaining Lab 3B than Lab3A. There are several questions where there is some option for freedom, creativity, and exploration so you can showcase your choices.

- Please do not explain the quadratic equation, how the `tree` command works, etc... Focus your explanations on your solutions and assume we know what the questions are asking.

- Have fun!

Note that you only need to create ONE video per lab (so Lab 2A and 2B should be shown in ONE video).

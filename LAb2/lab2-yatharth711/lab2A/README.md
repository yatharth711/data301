## Task 1: GitHub Tutorial

I will be honest: Git and GitHub is a difficult thing to teach so after many years of searching, I have found the [**PERFECT** tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org).
This tutorial, in addition to the videos for this week, will help you get more familiar with git commands, particularly branching, and merging - things you will start encountering when you start collaboratively working in your repos.

It is important to realize that in this course, you will not explicitly be tested on any git commands except `add`, `commit`,`fetch`,`push`,`pull`,`branch`.
You may be tempted to only those activities, but the more you play around and experiment with Git, the more comfortable you will be with it.

I recommend that complete the following modules, but you're more than welcome (and encouraged!) to do more, especially if you're having fun and learning.

- "Main: Introduction Sequence"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  
- "Ramping up"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4

- "Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

- "To Origin And Beyond -- Advanced Git Remotes!"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

Once you are done, you should include at most screenshots - one from the "Main" tab and one from the "Remotes" tab, though ideally if you can submit one screenshot that'll be easier for the TAs to grade.

Here is an example of the screenshot we are expecting.
